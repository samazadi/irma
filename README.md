# Irma

Hogwarts Library Web Portal

Named after [Madam Irma Pince](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Irma_Pince) who oversees The Hogwarts Library, this web application aims at reducing the stress that Madam Pince is under by allowing students and faculty to view, borrow, and return books. It also allows users to see the status and activites of all the books we have.

Donations are welcome as always!
